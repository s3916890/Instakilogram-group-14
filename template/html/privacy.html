        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Information and content you provide.</b> We collect the content, communications and other information
                you
                provide when you use our Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content
                and
                message or communicate with others. This can include information in or about the content that you
                provide
                (e.g. metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include
                what
                you see through features that we provide, such as our camera, so we can do things such as suggest masks
                and
                filters that you might like, or give you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process
                content and communications that you and others provide to analyse context and what's in them for the
                purposes described below. Learn more about how you can control who can see the things you share.

                Pages that you are connected to and how you interact with them across our Products, such as people you
                communicate with the most or groups that you are part of. We also collect contact information if you
                choose

                with
                and the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log when you're using and have
