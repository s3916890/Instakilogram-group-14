        <h3>Things that you and others do and provide. </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Information and content you provide.</b> We collect the content, communications and other information
                you
                provide when you use our Products, including when you sign up for an account, create or share content
                and
                message or communicate with others. This can include information in or about the content that you
                provide
                (e.g. metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created. It can also include
                what
                you see through features that we provide, such as our camera, so we can do things such as suggest masks
                and
                filters that you might like, or give you tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process
                content and communications that you and others provide to analyse context and what's in them for the
                purposes described below. Learn more about how you can control who can see the things you share.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Networks and connections.</b> We collect information about the people, accounts, hashtags, Facebook
                groups
                and
                Pages that you are connected to and how you interact with them across our Products, such as people you
                communicate with the most or groups that you are part of. We also collect contact information if you
                choose
                to upload, sync or import it from a device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history),
                which
                we use for things such as helping you and others find people you may know and for the other purposes
                listed
                below.

                with
                and the time, frequency and duration of your activities. For example, we log when you're using and have
                last

                other
                financial transactions (such as when you make a purchase in a game or make a donation), we collect
                information about the purchase or transaction. This includes payment information, such as your credit or
                debit card number and other card information, other account and authentication information, and billing,
